Throughout, Daniel highlights the major aspects of managing your Python development environment, shows you how to handle parallel computation, and helps you to master asynchronous I/O with Python 3.6 to improve performance. Finally, Daniel will teach you the secrets of metaprogramming and unit testing in Python, helping you acquire the perfect skillset to be a Python expert.

Daniel will get you up to speed on everything from basic programming practices to high-end tools and techniques, things that will help set you apart as a successful Python programmer.

The code will look like the following:
```
def example_function(name, radius):
  area = math.pi * radius ** 2
  return "The area of {} is {}" .format(name, area)
```

You will need Ubuntu 16.04 and Python (version 3.6). You can also run the code examples on Windows and macOS.
